# Eante Internship Challenge 2017
If you're reading this, you're probably interested in the Eante internship. If you're interested in us, we're interested in you!

Part of the job appplication includes writing a small project. This will help both you and us understand your suitability for this work. The problems you'll face in this project are very similar to what you'll face in the internship. I don't expect that many of you have used Meteor extensively before - so this will help both us and you understand how quickly you pick up Meteor.

You should be able to complete this project within 10-15 hours.

**Submissions close by 11:59pm on the 25th of April, 2017.**

Be aware, you should be free for an interview on the 29th or 30th of April. If you are not free on either of these dates, please let me know.

## Project
In this project, you'll be making a URL shortner. A URL shortener takes a long URL, and then turns it into a short URL. For example, goo.gl - Google's URL shortener.

### Goo.gl Example
https://github.com/Baralabite/RCJASS_Server/blob/master/src/network/address.py

Would become:

### Specifications
You are required to write this project in Meteor. You should create a web page which has an input for a long URL, and an output for the shortened URL. You may "pretty-ify" your page as much or as little as you want. Do remember that this position requires good amount of CSS and HTML knowledge.

At minimum you should have a text box, button, and label. Text box for long URL entry, button to shorten URL, and label to list the shortened URL.

#### Extra Points!
- Automagically copy shortened URL to clipboard when clicking on it
- Have a login system, and have past shortened URLs saved against accounts
- Make it look pretty! (Purty gradients? Idk.)

## Tips
New to Meteor? Follow the tutorial at [Meteor Tips](http://meteortips.com/). I learnt all the basics I needed to know from it.

Stuck on a UI library to use? I recommend using bootstrap:
 - [Bootstrap Homepage](http://getbootstrap.com/)
 - [Meteor Package](https://atmospherejs.com/twbs/bootstrap)

### Helpful Documentation
Meteor is comprised of a few basic key components, such as a Router (FlowRouter) and Templating Engine (Blaze). They are fairly well documented at the following links:
 - [FlowRouter](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router)
 - [Blaze](http://blazejs.org/)
 - [Meteor](https://docs.meteor.com/)

In your first instance, see if meteortips.com has what you're looking for - it might save you sifting through pages of docs.

## How to Submit
When starting, and finishing your project, fill out [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/nJ5bSnuKYwYu6PQC2). This is key to helping me know how long it took you to complete the project.

When you've finished the project, commit it to a git repository, and then email it to me at john@eante.com.au. After submitting, give me a few days to take a look at it - if you haven't heard back from me within 3 days, feel free to send me an email. 

I'll provide feedback on your code, and if I like what I see - I'll send you an email on next steps.

If you have any further questions, feel free to email me.
